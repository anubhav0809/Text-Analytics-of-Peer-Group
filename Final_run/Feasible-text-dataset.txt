Piastri has dominated everything he has done earlier. From F4 to f2
Wc in all categories
Would definitely learn this new car faster
W11 was a beast
Rocket on rails
Will never happen sadly
In all this chaos u forget u are still aiming to drive at the pinnacle of the sport. Maybe these guys know that they could get a seat in other formats of racing. Also he's loaded already. It's not an L , just disappointment ig
They should announce it already. 
What I meant is. He's already competing at the highest level in racing. But fighting for more/wins. Didn't say it's disappointing. He can always do something else if there is situation where no one signs him. For people like us , feeling bad for daniel not being in formula 1 is stupid.. he is in this position due to his own choices. It's disappointing he's not at the top anymore winning like before.
How long is this summer break
Kimi

Why r fans even using Twitter.
Nothing good ever comes from that platform 
Even Chris medland posts are put here by pranav and others.
Id prefer such groups and Instagram anyday.
Had to be either a mercedes or a rb fan
no wonder elon is hesitating to buy 
Hope no rain this year.. should be a good race
Is he talking about himself 
Maybe one day when lewis retires they could be better friends 
Mercedes have won for so long they got very cocky very soon.
It's time Ferrari and rb come back up again.
Does max prefer oversteer ? Heard this somewhere long ago
I mean a little bit..
Since last season his cars rears tend to slide around , visually atleast..
Interesting.
At first I thought he doesn't have the right balance but he keeps winning with this setup
Maybe even gets more temp on tyres that way considering the sliding around
Let's gooo
Atleast now they must announce about piastri
Raining this weekend at spa wtf ?
Both days
