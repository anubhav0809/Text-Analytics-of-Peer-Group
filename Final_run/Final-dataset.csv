8/6/22,18:59 ,A,Piastri has dominated everything he has done earlier. From F4 to f2
8/6/22,18:59 ,A,Wc in all categories
8/6/22,18:59 ,A,Would definitely learn this new car faster
8/6/22,21:03 ,A,W11 was a beast
8/6/22,21:03 ,A,Rocket on rails
8/7/22,19:40 ,A,Will never happen sadly
8/8/22,15:32 ,A,"In all this chaos u forget u are still aiming to drive at the pinnacle of the sport. Maybe these guys know that they could get a seat in other formats of racing. Also he's loaded already. It's not an L , just disappointment ig"
8/8/22,15:33 ,A,They should announce it already. 
8/9/22,05:08 ,A,"What I meant is. He's already competing at the highest level in racing. But fighting for more/wins. Didn't say it's disappointing. He can always do something else if there is situation where no one signs him. For people like us , feeling bad for daniel not being in formula 1 is stupid.. he is in this position due to his own choices. It's disappointing he's not at the top anymore winning like before."
8/11/22,17:39 ,A,How long is this summer break
8/11/22,23:12 ,A,Kimi
8/11/22,23:26 ,A,https://nypost.com/2022/08/09/ferrari-recalls-17-years-worth-of-cars-over-possible-brake-failure/amp/
8/12/22,21:13 ,A,Why r fans even using Twitter.
8/12/22,21:13 ,A,Nothing good ever comes from that platform 
8/12/22,21:14 ,A,Even Chris medland posts are put here by pranav and others.
8/12/22,21:14 ,A,Id prefer such groups and Instagram anyday.
8/12/22,21:15 ,A,Had to be either a mercedes or a rb fan
8/13/22,15:10 ,A,no wonder elon is hesitating to buy 
8/13/22,17:17 ,A,Hope no rain this year.. should be a good race
8/16/22,18:18 ,A,Is he talking about himself 
8/18/22,18:39 ,A,Maybe one day when lewis retires they could be better friends 
8/18/22,18:40 ,A,Mercedes have won for so long they got very cocky very soon.
8/18/22,18:40 ,A,It's time Ferrari and rb come back up again.
8/20/22,22:08 ,A,Does max prefer oversteer ? Heard this somewhere long ago
8/20/22,22:09 ,A,I mean a little bit..
8/20/22,22:09 ,A,"Since last season his cars rears tend to slide around , visually atleast.."
8/20/22,22:40 ,A,Interesting.
8/20/22,22:41 ,A,At first I thought he doesn't have the right balance but he keeps winning with this setup
8/20/22,22:41 ,A,Maybe even gets more temp on tyres that way considering the sliding around
8/22/22,11:15 ,A,Let's gooo
8/22/22,11:16 ,A,Atleast now they must announce about piastri
8/22/22,16:41 ,A,Raining this weekend at spa wtf ?
8/22/22,16:41 ,A,Both days 
8/22/22,19:24 ,A,https://youtu.be/txP754Hy3pA
8/23/22,19:51 ,A,I swear.
8/23/22,20:21 ,A,"Thursday is press con. Lot of updates i believe , should be worth it. Friday fp1 Jesus is back in Haas. New track reveal"
8/23/22,20:21 ,A,So just one more day
8/23/22,20:21 ,A,What? I thout spa !
8/23/22,20:22 ,A,Ah well.
8/24/22,19:53 ,A,He's won multiple times and was once a rb driver.. and the big personality or else yeah..
8/24/22,19:54 ,A,One Baku race and imola vs seb and this driver dive bombs.
8/24/22,19:55 ,A,Alpine is his best choice
8/24/22,19:55 ,A,Must be running his tattoo 
8/24/22,19:55 ,A,Rubbing*
8/24/22,19:56 ,A,They know questions will be asked about it tomorrow. Might as well reveal it beforehand
8/24/22,19:56 ,A,They'd wait until end of season as otmar has made it a legal issue for piastri
8/24/22,19:56 ,A,Until that's sorted.. they can't announce
8/24/22,20:57 ,A,Rb did not fuck up with their car. They were using Renault engines which were failing frequently. And Daniel chose to go with them instead. Was he poached ? Yes. Christian didn't want him to go. Rb were not ready clearly. They tried their luck with gasly albon in the coming years.
8/24/22,21:35 ,A,Yeah i get a feeling max would relax after 2 titles.. but u never know.
8/24/22,21:36 ,A,"I read and watched every interview he gave after Abu Dhabi last year and every statement he gave, he had no intentions fully, like 100% to come and win again. But here we are , he knows he has a car.. and he's going for it.."
8/24/22,21:37 ,A,I even noticed max seemed to have gained weight this season.. lol this is totally based on photos.. I'm not sure.. but he looks different
8/24/22,21:38 ,A,The pressure was unreal. Lewis did not make it easy. This season its so calm.
8/25/22,14:48 ,A,"nope, what is it ? reduced weight ?"
8/25/22,18:04 ,A,Yeah the black sweater is 
8/25/22,19:45 ,A,Max looks Mexican
8/26/22,12:51 ,A,https://youtu.be/_MLzH-stpcc
8/26/22,12:51 ,A,Audi x sauber
8/26/22,13:48 ,A,Niceeee.
8/26/22,13:48 ,A,Brackley
8/26/22,13:49 ,A,So yeah Germany would be first.
8/26/22,13:49 ,A,Rbpt UK Milton Keynes.
8/26/22,13:50 ,A,Porsche is next 
8/26/22,17:10 ,A,How long until fp1
8/26/22,17:21 ,A,"Guys I have a silly question. So Audi will manufacture the power unit. The engine also right ? Or since the specifications for the engine is same for all cars. Meaning 1.6l 1000bhp , it's standard ?"
8/26/22,17:21 ,A,"Is the engine ""standard"" same ?"
8/26/22,17:22 ,A,Or manufacturers like mercedes Ferrari rbpt make changes
8/26/22,17:23 ,A,Like i get all drive the V6 hybrid. Is the hybrid part the only difference ?
8/26/22,19:22 ,A,So true
8/26/22,19:23 ,A,True again.
8/26/22,19:24 ,A,
8/26/22,19:24 ,A,Gravel
8/26/22,19:25 ,A,And some beautiful strat from ferrari
8/26/22,19:25 ,A,Perfect combination
8/26/22,20:26 ,A,It's raining still
8/27/22,19:08 ,A,Lewis was 11th in fp3 doubt it.
8/27/22,19:08 ,A,Yeah no tyre temps that's all I heard too.
8/27/22,19:09 ,A,Hope it's a dry quali
8/27/22,19:09 ,A,Stroll for pole 
8/27/22,19:42 ,A,13 mins
8/27/22,19:45 ,A,Raining
8/27/22,19:45 ,A,
8/27/22,20:04 ,A,What was dangerous with tsunoda ?
8/27/22,20:07 ,A,So everyone has the new floor from this race right ?
8/27/22,20:17 ,A,Pushed it all the way ig
8/27/22,20:25 ,A,Perez on pole
8/27/22,20:47 ,A,What what what
8/27/22,20:47 ,A,Did they fuckup his tyres
8/27/22,20:47 ,A,So no fresh ones for the actual race ?
8/27/22,20:48 ,A,Broo
8/27/22,20:49 ,A,He could let's wait
8/27/22,20:50 ,A,Driving on Slow mode
8/27/22,20:50 ,A,Feel bad for charles.
8/27/22,20:52 ,A,Sergio time deleted ?
8/27/22,20:53 ,A,Smart to save tyres rb
8/27/22,20:54 ,A,Unlike Ferrari
8/27/22,20:55 ,A,Slow down lap. Nvm
8/27/22,20:55 ,A,Still lost time.. tow didn't work
8/27/22,20:56 ,A,Yeah perez better be on pole now
8/27/22,20:57 ,A,Wtf is it max on pole from the pit
8/27/22,20:58 ,A,They are worse than before.. what havoc
8/27/22,21:17 ,A,I even took a picture of it
8/27/22,21:17 ,A,
8/27/22,21:18 ,A,8 years this must the biggest gap
8/28/22,11:51 ,A,They tolerate him at this point.
8/28/22,16:47 ,A,Either of the mercs mess with a McLaren or alpine . That's my wild prediction.. 
8/28/22,16:49 ,A,.
8/28/22,17:02 ,A,"I'm borderline nervous with every driver on the grid suggesting that "" oh let's see how far off we finish from max "" his pace was incredible sure.. but there are fewer laps today in the entire race. 43 ? Ig.. sure he will overtake a few cars but anything can happen"
8/28/22,17:02 ,A,"Also he took pole from the pits , when was the last time we saw that ?"
8/28/22,17:02 ,A,6 tenths ahead. In 1 run.
8/28/22,17:03 ,A,Didn't even wait for track evolution
8/28/22,17:04 ,A,Yeah they are so confident about their package. Mainly because max dominated the practice sessions also.. Leclerc was nowhere close.. he's got a new pu also
8/28/22,17:05 ,A,Yeah sure. It's more or less the same.. rb has got the top speed to comfortably lead
8/28/22,17:06 ,A,So much.. only safety cars could give them a competitive edge.. and some really good strategy..
8/28/22,17:06 ,A,But merc look slow. So atleast one Ferrari driver gets podium
8/28/22,17:07 ,A,Fernando can be top 5
8/28/22,17:07 ,A,When was the last time he started with a penalty ?
8/28/22,17:07 ,A,He didn't even finish top 5 i believe.
8/28/22,17:09 ,A,Canada p5
8/28/22,17:09 ,A,He started p20
8/28/22,17:13 ,A,Yup
8/28/22,17:14 ,A,New pu for yuki
8/28/22,17:44 ,A,He deserves a seat next year
8/28/22,18:35 ,A,Lol
8/28/22,18:35 ,A,Told yal
8/28/22,18:39 ,A,Yeah it's okay.. lewis fault
8/28/22,18:39 ,A,Fuck that
8/28/22,18:44 ,A,Perez better be awake
8/28/22,18:45 ,A,Fernando no damage it seems
8/28/22,18:45 ,A,Glad
8/28/22,18:46 ,A,Too ambitious
8/28/22,18:46 ,A,Generally he waits
8/28/22,18:46 ,A,Oh the memes
8/28/22,18:49 ,A,What is max on!!!!
8/28/22,18:49 ,A,It's like everyone else is driving F2 cars
8/28/22,18:50 ,A,Lewis dnf. Who will they penalise ?
8/28/22,18:57 ,A,Are they forcing Sainz to pit
8/28/22,18:57 ,A,Yeah it worked
8/28/22,18:57 ,A,Pressure from both bulls Ferrari pits
8/28/22,19:06 ,A,George.. wow..
8/28/22,19:06 ,A,Respecccc
8/28/22,19:09 ,A,Max in drs 
8/28/22,19:14 ,A,They're afraid 
8/28/22,19:14 ,A,It's best to let drivers decide on strategy
8/28/22,19:18 ,A,Righhttt good for him
8/28/22,19:21 ,A,Vettel p7 pretty good for aston
8/28/22,19:37 ,A,What did max say ?
8/28/22,19:41 ,A,Why isn't Leclerc pushing.. new components
8/28/22,19:41 ,A,How can they not catch a mercedes !
8/28/22,19:42 ,A,They've even given him mediums
8/28/22,19:42 ,A,He admits.. good job
8/28/22,19:43 ,A,Damn baguette
8/28/22,19:43 ,A,What a move
8/28/22,19:58 ,A,
8/28/22,19:58 ,A,Lol this is a joke
8/28/22,19:59 ,A,Stealing fastest lap from who and for what ?
8/28/22,20:00 ,A,Why did he slide like that
8/28/22,20:00 ,A,Scary
8/28/22,20:01 ,A,Max got the fastest lap
8/28/22,20:02 ,A,Charles Leclerc speeding in pitlane
8/28/22,20:02 ,A,But not on track
8/28/22,20:04 ,A,Whatttttt
8/28/22,20:04 ,A,5 sec
8/28/22,20:04 ,A,Nando p5
8/28/22,20:04 ,A,Brooooo
8/28/22,20:04 ,A,Legends 
8/28/22,20:05 ,A,Charles should move to mercedes that's enough
8/28/22,20:05 ,A,Lewis retires Charles in
8/28/22,20:05 ,A,This is bullshit.. waste of his talent..
8/28/22,20:06 ,A,At this rate max wins a race or two early.
8/28/22,20:12 ,A,So p6 right
8/28/22,20:12 ,A,Who was 7 8
8/28/22,20:30 ,A,Fernando was pointing fingers at lewis in the safety car lap.. lol
8/28/22,20:37 ,A,Fernando was sprayed with oil after the crash..
8/28/22,20:37 ,A,Luckily it was lap 1 so I don't think it was hot..
8/28/22,20:38 ,A,True
8/28/22,20:38 ,A,Just imagining ways a F1 driver can get hurt.. it's crazy
8/28/22,20:38 ,A,Lewis could have engine damage. Or something that serves him a penalty in future
8/28/22,20:39 ,A,Man was elevated
8/28/22,20:41 ,A,If they were sponsored by oil giants and automobile constructor's maybe they would 
8/28/22,21:04 ,A,Charles was 81kmph
8/28/22,21:04 ,A,Just 1 kmph extra
8/28/22,21:04 ,A,In the pitlane
8/28/22,21:04 ,A,A bit harsh on the penalty.
8/28/22,21:35 ,A,Mario kart
8/28/22,21:35 ,A,Haha yeah
8/28/22,22:03 ,A,TD hurt the Ferrari more than rb it seems..?
8/28/22,22:03 ,A,They can't be so off the pace especially with new components
8/28/22,22:13 ,A,Is that a neck brace
8/29/22,12:12 ,A,Records are meant to be broken
8/29/22,12:12 ,A,With more races per year it was supposed to happen
8/29/22,14:52 ,A,Not really.. max lewis bottas were looking good last year
8/29/22,14:53 ,A,Are u p9 or p10 - question
8/29/22,17:00 ,A,It's happening 
8/29/22,17:57 ,A,https://www.instagram.com/reel/ChfWqfJD17C/?igshid=MDJmNzVkMjY=
8/29/22,19:41 ,A,This season doesn't even come close to last year
8/29/22,19:41 ,A,Every race was incredible
8/29/22,19:42 ,A,Silly season indeed.
8/29/22,19:51 ,A,Nope. There was an actual battle on lap 1 every race ! Both merc and rb had good strategies and had a plan of action. It was super competitive. Also masi made it so interesting with the penalties and decisions.
8/29/22,19:51 ,A,Every race someone shared 10 PDFs in this group chat on news from the FIA
8/29/22,19:52 ,A,Ferrari has given up for the season. It's just preparation for next season now.
8/29/22,19:56 ,A,"Bro. Max had a lot of poor starts , lewis was on it. Everyone just prayed they didn't touch wheels. Yes battle !"
8/29/22,21:13 ,A,Time to fit in the Brazil power unit 
8/29/22,21:13 ,A,From last year
8/29/22,21:14 ,A,George would be in contention of a championship battle before Leclerc if merc are stronger next season
8/29/22,21:15 ,A,So consistent
8/29/22,21:15 ,A,"New car, regs.. always managing well.."
8/29/22,21:16 ,A,Would like that honestly
8/29/22,21:16 ,A,New car since he came from a Williams.
8/29/22,21:16 ,A,Although he had driven it before..
8/29/22,21:29 ,A,If mercedes had the same car this season. Who would win.. ferrari or mercedes
8/29/22,21:29 ,A,With lewis and George. And all the experience they bring
8/29/22,21:30 ,A,Do u see them making the same mistakes
8/29/22,21:30 ,A,Yeah but u get the point right..
8/29/22,21:30 ,A,If mercedes find the deficit pace next year. It's merc vs rb again
8/29/22,21:31 ,A,Lewis will be on and off podiums
8/29/22,21:31 ,A,"Let's see , i don't see him winning another championship."
8/29/22,21:32 ,A,I could be wrong but doesn't seem like he would now...
8/29/22,21:32 ,A,With everyone elbows out and a fairly descent car..
8/29/22,21:32 ,A,Extremely good car.. like the rb
8/29/22,21:33 ,A,Can't blame him. He's always driven a near perfect car last 5 seasons
8/29/22,21:33 ,A,Only a certain tracks didn't suit them.. or else they were always pushing and in podiums
8/29/22,22:15 ,A,Check lewis insta story.
8/29/22,22:15 ,A,Someone called him an idiot.
8/29/22,22:15 ,A,Mans hurt 
8/29/22,22:29 ,A,That Ferrari intiative against cyber bullying and racist comments is a month old now.. he shared it again to make a point obviously
8/29/22,22:29 ,A,Fia*
8/29/22,22:30 ,A,Should delete Ferrari  what nonsense autocorrect 
8/30/22,18:23 ,A,Schumacher leaving Ferrari ? Confirmed i guess
8/30/22,20:14 ,A,"Well, he took the L in his username"
8/31/22,13:01 ,A,Someone's crashing for sure
8/31/22,21:54 ,A,They will announce tomorrow right ? Alpine regarding next year
9/1/22,12:35 ,A,Media isn't dumb it's clickbait
9/1/22,14:12 ,A,Even if Oscar loses this case. How is it possible that alpine take him. Will he be on good terms with otmar. ?
9/1/22,14:12 ,A,"I can't believe a scenario if they win, they keep him.. it's just about the money I believe"
9/1/22,14:13 ,A,Can't take money from him and ask him to be ur driver. 
9/1/22,14:54 ,A,Gasly to alpine muscle 
9/1/22,17:39 ,A,Max verstappen is now an officer
9/1/22,17:40 ,A,"Sir lewis , officer max"
9/1/22,17:40 ,A,
9/1/22,21:23 ,A,
9/1/22,21:51 ,A,https://youtu.be/9Tk77M54KxM
9/1/22,22:18 ,A,Gasly to alpine. Mic to alpha tauri
9/2/22,11:19 ,A,So they reduce speed but not cause gravel to be on track
9/2/22,11:19 ,A,Is that correct ?
9/2/22,11:19 ,A,Resin like material. ?
9/2/22,11:20 ,A,Interesting.
9/2/22,11:20 ,A,Full throttle banking with drs . So just make it easier for max effectively
9/2/22,11:28 ,A,How long until fp1
9/2/22,14:01 ,A,We want smoke 
9/2/22,14:02 ,A,Beach is so close. Should be windy anyway
9/2/22,16:48 ,A,"Yes! Races get cancelled or moved , they don't update. Same issue."
9/2/22,16:48 ,A,I ask for timings here 
9/2/22,17:21 ,A,Transmission smoked
9/2/22,17:21 ,A,In his 3rd lap ig. Didn't do any further runs.
9/2/22,17:24 ,A,"Clearly. Bothered merc,Ferrari, maybe haas instead."
9/2/22,17:25 ,A,Alpine  doing well
9/2/22,19:25 ,A,Lol so otmar gets no compensation ?
9/2/22,19:25 ,A,They should get him on the radio in fp2
9/2/22,19:29 ,A,Hotstar issue anyone ?
9/2/22,19:30 ,A,It was live sometime ago 
9/2/22,19:30 ,A,Yes 
9/2/22,19:33 ,A,Delayed
9/2/22,19:36 ,A,"He knows he's good. Also backed by good sponsors. Has won almost every championship he's been a part of. With alpine , he did an internship. Job offer from McLaren"
9/2/22,19:36 ,A,"He must have noticed something in alpine , or the money who knows. But yea I get ur point.. he was an investment from alpines end."
9/2/22,19:37 ,A,Fair point
9/2/22,19:54 ,A,Were they planning to make him a reserve driver ?
9/2/22,19:54 ,A,J.Button said it's too early for piastri to be making F1 enemies this early.
9/3/22,15:31 ,A,Saw the whole thing.. he was grilled with questions
9/3/22,18:19 ,A,Who gets pole
9/3/22,18:19 ,A,I think Charles or sainz 
9/3/22,18:19 ,A,Max had it difficult throughout..
9/3/22,18:48 ,A,What is this quali 
9/3/22,18:50 ,A,Ikr!
9/3/22,18:50 ,A,pretty much the wind affecting the speeds and gaps now
9/3/22,18:51 ,A,He gave up on his lap
9/3/22,18:54 ,A,Super. Merc look strong here
9/3/22,18:54 ,A,Might just outpace ferrari
9/3/22,19:00 ,A,Idiots
9/3/22,19:01 ,A,"Could ruin a lap, damage a car."
9/3/22,19:06 ,A,It's the best gp to be at arguably
9/3/22,19:06 ,A,I'm terms of experience
9/3/22,19:09 ,A,Mate i don't know.. just repeating what I heard from max and Daniels performance coach.
9/3/22,19:09 ,A,On a pod
9/3/22,19:09 ,A,This is more like a festival too. Party scenes and Dutch are known to have good music festivals.
9/3/22,19:10 ,A,Closer to Amsterdam
9/3/22,19:38 ,A,This guy is on another level
9/3/22,19:38 ,A,Let's go maxxx 
9/3/22,19:40 ,A,Yeah i think lewis had to let go of the throttle
9/3/22,19:40 ,A,But ferrari brought their A game in q3
9/4/22,08:31 ,A,Is this edited or real?
9/4/22,18:13 ,A,At this rate they will have another circuit in America and scrap a european circuit
9/4/22,18:26 ,A,I never liked Jeddah so much
9/4/22,18:26 ,A,Cool setup
9/4/22,18:27 ,A,No we want a good fight till the end.
9/4/22,18:27 ,A,I reckon they stop twice
9/4/22,18:27 ,A,Softs won't last

9/4/22,19:46 ,A,
9/4/22,19:46 ,A,I hope this is good
9/4/22,19:47 ,A,Car is basically in qualifying condition
9/4/22,19:47 ,A,Low fuel
9/4/22,19:47 ,A,Almost new softs
9/4/22,19:49 ,A,Ham pits
9/4/22,19:49 ,A,Chaossss
9/4/22,19:49 ,A,I need to see the highlights
9/4/22,19:49 ,A,Idk what is happening anymore
9/4/22,19:51 ,A,Is ferrari even in the championship
9/4/22,19:52 ,A,Penalty night
9/4/22,19:53 ,A,Lapped cars trauma
9/4/22,19:53 ,A,And lewis is P1 
9/4/22,19:53 ,A,Is he right behind me
9/4/22,19:53 ,A,On new tyres
9/4/22,19:54 ,A,Rb has the pace come on!!
9/4/22,19:54 ,A,12 laps
9/4/22,19:55 ,A,Loooooll
9/4/22,19:56 ,A,They want the 2-3
9/4/22,19:56 ,A,Waved him bye
9/4/22,19:57 ,A,Finishing ahead of Ferrari. Still a good day for them
9/4/22,19:58 ,A,What could merc do more ???
9/4/22,19:58 ,A,Man big F for ferrari
9/4/22,19:59 ,A,Imagine
9/4/22,19:59 ,A,We have Nico on the radio today lol
9/4/22,19:59 ,A,He wanted softs ?? What is he crying about
9/4/22,20:01 ,A,
9/4/22,20:04 ,A,"Sainz didn't slow under yellows , unsafe release.."
9/4/22,20:06 ,A,Not even top 10
9/4/22,20:06 ,A,He was almost pole
9/4/22,20:35 ,A,She cute 
9/4/22,20:39 ,A,At this point looking at the floods in Pak. They need the win.
9/4/22,20:40 ,A,https://www.instagram.com/p/CiDmpN4hw2X/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=
9/4/22,20:42 ,A,As expected it's a penalty night..
9/4/22,20:42 ,A,Many drivers called to stewards
9/4/22,20:53 ,A,Binotto will never accept fault
9/4/22,20:54 ,A,Only pace an issue according to ferrari
9/4/22,21:30 ,A,Interesting thing is.. this is kinda like Abu Dhabi.. rb trust max and his ability to overtake.. they sacrifice his track position and make him pit for softs.. whereas lewis on mediums.. yet again stays out.
9/4/22,21:31 ,A,"Imagine these theories if it was gasly instead of latifi last year, last race."
9/4/22,21:32 ,A,TG it was a Williams 
9/4/22,21:33 ,A,"Colton is taking his seat, he's going alpine next year."
9/4/22,21:34 ,A,We should know by next week
9/4/22,22:03 ,A,Who got fastest lap
9/4/22,22:03 ,A,Who is willeard
9/4/22,22:03 ,A,
9/5/22,11:37 ,A,I guess as per the starting grid position it's not considered?
9/5/22,16:42 ,A,What a beautiful answer
9/5/22,16:43 ,A,He's really championship material 
9/5/22,16:51 ,A,It's simple. If u make fun of lewis or max. In a way ur suggesting that the other driver has no talent and wins only because of the car.. respect between competitors is necessary. Or ur fav driver is like any other driver.
9/5/22,16:52 ,A,I'm yet to hear hamilton saying max has driven well this season.. he knows it. He won't say it.. max has no ego admitting it.
9/5/22,16:52 ,A,"Since the start of the season hamilton has said it's the car. The redbull "" car "" is fast."
9/5/22,16:52 ,A,When we all know the deficit between max and perez.
9/5/22,16:53 ,A,Let's say it's 50-50 and move on.
9/5/22,16:53 ,A,"Or else , daniel would have a seat today"
9/5/22,16:54 ,A,He better finish P2 in the championship
9/5/22,20:08 ,A,U also share 
9/5/22,21:34 ,A,But he doesn't have a good reason as excuse for the decisions his team makes. Or its too private for the rest of us
9/5/22,21:36 ,A,"She giggled between a pressure situation, toxic fans hated that.."
9/5/22,21:37 ,A,Also has been doing a steller job in strategy so is quite in the limelight. Unacceptable behaviour
9/5/22,22:12 ,A,This message was deleted
9/5/22,22:20 ,A,I think we need a safety car 
9/5/22,22:22 ,A,Let it go guys. This is not why this group was made. We have Twitter for this.
9/5/22,22:25 ,A,Last season the steward drama made it interesting ngl
9/5/22,22:25 ,A,Except the toxicity between fans
9/5/22,22:26 ,A,Good suspense towards the end
9/5/22,22:26 ,A,Staying up late at night to read a pdf from fia
9/6/22,17:17 ,A,If he finishes in points would be legit fun
9/6/22,17:17 ,A,Hope it rains. 
9/7/22,14:48 ,A,I mean he did he say he was confused
9/9/22,09:40 ,A,He's never won monza
9/9/22,09:40 ,A,5th at best.
9/9/22,09:41 ,A,"Last year rb had the pace for a podium atleast.. but they messed up with his pit stop, his outlap was slow"
9/9/22,09:41 ,A,And then we all know what happened
9/9/22,09:42 ,A,"Ferrari could be lucky with the yellow or super unlucky , fingers crossed"
9/9/22,09:44 ,A,Have to be.  They are taking a step backwards every race
9/9/22,13:42 ,A,He is sick
9/9/22,16:52 ,A,Max too right ?
9/9/22,16:52 ,A,Oh nvm
9/9/22,16:53 ,A,Is this the last change until the end of season ?
9/9/22,16:53 ,A,I doubt reliability are still major concerns at rb. Why the frequent changes
9/9/22,17:00 ,A,Maybe so.. i hope the reasons are for the better
9/9/22,17:00 ,A,Monza is easy overtaking on the straights.
9/9/22,17:00 ,A,He can finish 1st with pitlane start. Not worried
9/9/22,17:03 ,A,Meh
9/9/22,17:04 ,A,Drs train issue is very midfield specific
9/9/22,17:04 ,A,P1 to p5 not an issue
9/9/22,18:31 ,A,Can ferrari win this 
9/9/22,18:31 ,A,1:22:4 is good!
9/9/22,18:35 ,A,"Soon we will say ""are rb sandbagging"" "
9/9/22,18:36 ,A,I mean it could be.. their fresh new engine blew up in Bahrain
9/9/22,18:36 ,A,Maybe it's some conservative mode
9/10/22,09:25 ,A,Mercedes 
9/10/22,12:46 ,A,https://youtu.be/-1zFzWPNcqo
9/10/22,16:12 ,A,so nyck has driven 3 different cars in the last few months
9/10/22,16:13 ,A,aston mercedes and williams
9/10/22,16:34 ,A,Schumacher ocon magnussen max perez lewis
9/10/22,16:34 ,A,Penalty
9/10/22,16:34 ,A,Who else 
9/10/22,17:22 ,A, another day another max pole
9/10/22,17:22 ,A,Still gets the tyre
9/10/22,17:22 ,A,And the record ? Is that in the books
9/10/22,18:04 ,A,https://youtu.be/qTVtutHv7eA
9/10/22,19:46 ,A,Yes
9/10/22,19:47 ,A,They've turned it on for the car exhaust audio
9/10/22,20:27 ,A,Ferrari go brrr
9/10/22,20:27 ,A,1-2
9/10/22,20:27 ,A,Rb missing a few tenths
9/10/22,20:28 ,A,McLaren competitive
9/10/22,20:33 ,A,Ferrari rear wing working.. good for them
9/10/22,20:35 ,A,Medium stint rb is faster
9/10/22,20:48 ,A,Only way to win this
9/10/22,20:48 ,A,Especially for overtakes u need a fast car on mediums
9/10/22,21:42 ,A,This is not correct right ?
9/10/22,21:42 ,A,How's max p4
9/10/22,21:42 ,A,With a 5 place grid penalty
9/10/22,21:43 ,A,2+5 p7 no?
9/10/22,22:00 ,A,So many penalties 
9/11/22,17:04 ,A,How long until race
9/11/22,17:04 ,A,6.30 ist right ?
9/11/22,18:36 ,A,P3 already
9/11/22,18:36 ,A,Maxxxx
9/11/22,18:47 ,A,Perez 
9/11/22,18:47 ,A,So unfortunate
9/11/22,18:47 ,A,If the fire doesn't go out
9/11/22,18:47 ,A,He will
9/11/22,18:47 ,A,Break bias now -2
9/11/22,18:54 ,A,I think it's not.. but let's see
9/11/22,18:54 ,A,Towards they end that medium will suffer..
9/11/22,18:57 ,A,Nha he's using engine breaking
9/11/22,18:57 ,A,Instead of heating the breaks
9/11/22,19:07 ,A,Lol maxs gf yawning in the back 
9/11/22,19:25 ,A,Should max pit for soft
9/11/22,19:25 ,A,Bro Leclerc is already on soft
9/11/22,19:26 ,A,And he is catching max soon.
9/11/22,19:29 ,A,Old sets ?
9/11/22,19:29 ,A,Damn.. should have given him mediums then
9/11/22,19:45 ,A,Race won't resume ig
9/11/22,19:46 ,A,Max Sainz new rest old
9/11/22,19:46 ,A,Nicee
9/11/22,19:47 ,A,Scrub soft gp said on radio
9/11/22,19:48 ,A,Clutch disengages gear no??
9/11/22,19:48 ,A,Oh ok
9/11/22,19:50 ,A,Perez gotta do what max did last year
9/11/22,19:50 ,A,Nicee
9/11/22,19:50 ,A,Same number of dnfs as Abu Dhabi right ?
9/11/22,19:52 ,A,Boooooringgg
9/11/22,19:53 ,A,Nyck 
9/11/22,19:54 ,A,Max would have won this either way.. who are we kidding.. 
9/11/22,19:54 ,A,No mate.. not even close.
9/11/22,19:55 ,A,Yeah exactly.. 17+ seconds
9/11/22,19:55 ,A,He wasn't catching max either way..
9/11/22,19:59 ,A,So deserving..
9/11/22,20:00 ,A,Eat Daniels he won't need them 
9/11/22,20:01 ,A,Like it will bother them at this point 
9/11/22,20:02 ,A,It has begun
9/11/22,20:03 ,A,I read a board in the crowd binnotto out
9/11/22,20:03 ,A,So they hate him as much as we do 
9/11/22,20:09 ,A,Red plus yellow is orange. 
9/11/22,20:09 ,A,Thanks tifosi
9/11/22,20:09 ,A,
9/11/22,20:10 ,A,Ferrari strat good.. but not great.
9/11/22,20:16 ,A,This race was a snooze fest
9/11/22,20:16 ,A,Compared to last year
9/11/22,20:16 ,A,Ferrari was not competitive on race pace.. others were just slower than them.
9/11/22,20:17 ,A,So Singapore dnf for charles.. 
9/11/22,20:18 ,A,True. But I hope atleast mercedes find some pace to challenge max.
9/11/22,20:19 ,A,Max has had a faultless season
9/11/22,20:19 ,A,It was over by now 
9/12/22,05:17 ,A,So ideally he gets Williams seat first and then graduates to mercedes
9/12/22,19:08 ,A,shit
9/12/22,19:08 ,A,Hope he makes fulls recovery
9/12/22,22:02 ,A,Why didnt fia red flag the race. ?
9/12/22,22:03 ,A,Ending behind a safety car not fun
9/12/22,22:07 ,A,"Just red flag it then. Last 10 laps if a car breaks down in a tough spot. Red flag , coz I guess adding more laps would be a fuel and weight concern"
9/12/22,22:10 ,A,Well this needs to change. U get sporting regulations or entertainment.. middle ground is to keep both parties happy.
9/12/22,22:11 ,A,"Anyway max was faster , wouldn't have mattered but still.."
9/12/22,22:11 ,A,He should have red flagged it
9/12/22,22:11 ,A,Lewis and max both get fresh tyres
9/12/22,22:11 ,A,Would have been fair
9/12/22,22:14 ,A,Why so ? If u have them use them
9/12/22,22:16 ,A,Ferrari actually fucked up on strategy. It just doesn't look as bad since we expect the worst already.
9/12/22,22:16 ,A,I watched the post race show. They were suffering from high deg already
9/12/22,22:16 ,A,They made poor choices yesterday also
9/12/22,22:17 ,A,Why just Charles and max.. think about George perez. Lewis..
9/12/22,22:17 ,A,This isn't about P1 only
9/12/22,22:19 ,A,Fair
9/12/22,22:20 ,A,Tell this to lewis.. 
9/12/22,22:21 ,A,"Either he doesn't pit or he hates the idea of drivers gaining an advantage from red flags.. Jeddah, turkey are just examples of it."
9/12/22,22:21 ,A,Hungary also I think
9/12/22,22:22 ,A,Knowing that u have a faster car and a driver like lewis.. they should take such risks
9/12/22,22:23 ,A,He's here to stay in the sport for another two years minimum..
9/12/22,22:24 ,A,Next year its three way battle
9/12/22,22:26 ,A,Ferrari will have better reliability hopefully and perform on specific tracks.. rb will be in the mix always since they are already few tenths up. Mercedes will improve.
9/12/22,22:26 ,A,Still is.. Russell is the faster than lewis this year.. he's adapted to the car better than lewis imo.
9/12/22,22:29 ,A,Just based of the number of years spent in F1 and a new team for him.. Russell is doing a mega job driving a bouncy car. I see him winning a championship atleast once if he has the car
9/12/22,22:29 ,A,So consistent
9/12/22,22:31 ,A,Just watching videos from last season. Max looks lean
9/12/22,22:31 ,A,His face has stress all over it.. or maybe he just gained some weight this season..
9/12/22,22:31 ,A,But he looked different..
9/12/22,22:32 ,A,That's the thing right.. u need that agression for a championship..
9/12/22,22:32 ,A,Charles is soft
9/12/22,22:33 ,A,"Can u say that given the same car , Charles vs lewis.. last year.."
9/12/22,22:33 ,A,Can charles win ?
9/12/22,22:33 ,A,Tough to say
9/12/22,22:35 ,A,When his contract ends he's going to mercedes 
9/13/22,08:01 ,A,Hulk n kmag in Haas !? 
9/13/22,08:01 ,A,Balls will be sucked 
9/14/22,11:15 ,A,This can be a nice printer ad
9/14/22,11:15 ,A,HP should pick it up
9/22/22,21:29 ,A,What 
9/22/22,22:12 ,A,Oh yeah! Same font has the one below. Definitely fake
9/22/22,22:16 ,A,Instagram crashed ?
9/22/22,22:16 ,A,Is it working for you guys
9/25/22,21:18 ,A,He means Austin ?
9/26/22,16:32 ,A,Audi x Alfa Romeo ?
9/28/22,18:35 ,A,Brooklyn Beckhams ex
9/30/22,16:23 ,A,3 tens
9/30/22,16:24 ,A,Perez with reliability issue ?
9/30/22,16:25 ,A,Lewis
9/30/22,16:39 ,A,"Happened behind him, he didn't slow down"
10/1/22,11:32 ,A,Yea someone will crash tonight
10/1/22,13:38 ,A,Lol y
10/1/22,14:20 ,A,"I have to say I would be to. He's already guilty before anything is proven. March 2022 they submitted the accounts, it took them this long to come up with these accusations ? Who even started them ? Every social media account is naming aston and rb to have had exceeded the cap. Espnf1, autosport. Everyone.."
10/1/22,14:20 ,A,Toto also not holding back with his comments. 
10/1/22,15:41 ,A,
10/1/22,15:42 ,A,That amg looks sick in the rain
10/1/22,15:42 ,A,It has a special floor
10/1/22,15:43 ,A,Exactly 
10/1/22,15:43 ,A,Did ferrari forget what they do in 2019
10/1/22,15:43 ,A,Merc i understand they salty
10/1/22,16:30 ,A,Charles  engine issues
10/1/22,17:29 ,A,
10/1/22,17:29 ,A,This again
10/1/22,18:27 ,A,No
10/1/22,18:27 ,A,But it could
10/1/22,18:30 ,A,They r going out on inters 
10/1/22,19:38 ,A,Max still winning this 
10/1/22,19:39 ,A,If it's dry and clean without SC issues
10/1/22,19:39 ,A,No doubt he gets it done. 
10/1/22,20:03 ,A,I mean fans asked for it..
10/2/22,00:39 ,A,"I read a comment on the max outburst when he was asked to box. "" No budget for the fuel anymore "" "
10/2/22,17:36 ,A,Delayed ??
10/2/22,17:37 ,A,What??!!?
10/2/22,17:37 ,A,Why?
10/2/22,18:00 ,A,Bruhh
10/2/22,18:02 ,A,Not working
10/2/22,18:04 ,A,this works thanks bru
10/2/22,18:06 ,A, whenn
10/2/22,18:06 ,A,It's still the formation lap
10/2/22,18:06 ,A,Are they repairing ?
10/2/22,18:09 ,A,Hotstar is a dick. Think their contract only allows them to show the main race.
10/2/22,18:09 ,A,Thanks for link 
10/2/22,18:10 ,A,Singapore never finishes under the time limit. I read somewhere..
10/2/22,18:10 ,A,It always exceeds the time limit
10/2/22,18:10 ,A,2hr plus.
10/2/22,18:10 ,A,26 mins until lights out..
10/2/22,18:58 ,A,To Russell
10/2/22,18:58 ,A,He crashed bottas
10/2/22,19:03 ,A,Brilliant
10/2/22,19:10 ,A,Max should have had a better start.
10/2/22,19:43 ,A,Whoaaa

10/5/22,15:09 ,A,Slightly worried
10/5/22,17:03 ,A,Heart rate go brrrrr
10/5/22,17:42 ,A,
10/5/22,20:29 ,A,UPDATE: The FIA wont conclude analysis of financial submissions today. New date given is Monday 10 October #F1
10/7/22,07:32 ,A,It's raining 
10/7/22,16:34 ,A,Everybody talks here as if they work with fia  and have the audited bills. Relax
10/7/22,16:34 ,A,"U know only what's been disclosed by media, rb representatives"
10/7/22,16:34 ,A,And rumours from different sources.
10/7/22,16:36 ,A,The entire contract can be read in different ways by law. If not worded correctly.
10/7/22,16:37 ,A,The contract is never public information.
10/7/22,16:37 ,A,So everybody calm down.
10/7/22,16:45 ,A,Obviously.
10/8/22,05:58 ,A,After checo leaves double Dutch delight
10/8/22,06:42 ,A,"Haas is taking time. They would probably disclose something in Austin. Decide when the dust settles in the driver market. Steiner wants someone experienced, so don't expect a rookie joining."
10/8/22,06:43 ,A,Williams will have a rookie most probably.
10/8/22,08:31 ,A,? It's wrong why the 
10/8/22,08:33 ,A,We have a dry quali
10/8/22,08:34 ,A,Reserve role most likely..
10/8/22,08:36 ,A,Haas will get someone like hulkenberg
10/8/22,08:37 ,A,Maybe Williams 
10/8/22,11:31 ,A,Bruh what's ferrari doing with Charles car
10/8/22,11:33 ,A,Who isn't..  he deserves it
10/8/22,11:34 ,A,"Well, we will see next year"

10/8/22,12:25 ,A,Putting heat in tyres
10/8/22,12:25 ,A,Idk what made him do that
10/8/22,12:26 ,A,Yea he slowed down for a gap between him and rb.. then went full speed
10/8/22,12:27 ,A,Yeah it's fine. As it was an outlap.. had it been a quali run it should have been a grid penalty for sure..
10/8/22,12:31 ,A,Lol yeah
10/8/22,12:31 ,A,Think he could have gone faster in sector 1
10/8/22,12:32 ,A,Fml
10/8/22,12:32 ,A,Weight reduced 
10/8/22,12:33 ,A,Diffuser broke
10/8/22,12:45 ,A,Towards a British driver u mean
10/8/22,12:46 ,A,Lando and max are . No investigation necessary 
10/8/22,12:49 ,A,Latifis fault
10/8/22,13:54 ,A,Even with a 5 place grid penalty max can pass the competition.
10/8/22,14:14 ,A,Did anyone improve on their final run ?
10/8/22,14:14 ,A,Hope the damage to the car isn't big and can be repaired in parc ferme
10/9/22,10:28 ,A,Wet race 100%

10/9/22,11:16 ,A,Learnt nothing from it. So much for safety.
10/9/22,11:19 ,A,
10/9/22,11:20 ,A,If this was pre 2015 we would have started

10/9/22,12:36 ,A,Latifi should win this 
10/9/22,13:05 ,A,Mick clearing water for everyone
10/9/22,13:13 ,A,LEC has fastest lap since past 5 mins. Still the gap is increasing between him and max
10/9/22,13:13 ,A,How ?!
10/9/22,13:15 ,A,Ah right..
10/9/22,13:16 ,A,Damn ocon defending for life
10/9/22,13:17 ,A,Hoping for Race wins.
10/9/22,13:23 ,A,Perez s message to europe
10/9/22,13:23 ,A,
10/9/22,13:24 ,A,Russell would have gone past baguette by now
10/9/22,13:24 ,A,Ham not in his element
10/9/22,13:24 ,A,Ocon also just v good
10/9/22,13:26 ,A,Nando pits

10/9/22,13:29 ,A,This should be like football. +5 over time 
10/9/22,13:37 ,A,What a race
10/9/22,13:37 ,A,Perez p2
10/9/22,13:38 ,A,Alonso overtake must be insane
10/9/22,13:38 ,A,They didn't show it though
10/9/22,13:39 ,A,Leclerc tyres look like slicks fuck
10/9/22,13:40 ,A,Ocon dotd
10/9/22,13:40 ,A,LEC under investigation
10/9/22,13:41 ,A,5 sec penalty
10/9/22,13:41 ,A,Perez p2
10/9/22,13:41 ,A,Confirm

10/9/22,13:41 ,A,Official
10/9/22,13:41 ,A,P3
10/9/22,13:43 ,A,Lfgoooooooo
10/9/22,13:51 ,A,Let's savour the moment
10/9/22,13:51 ,A,All questions will be cleared
10/9/22,13:57 ,A,Cry
10/9/22,13:57 ,A,
10/9/22,14:01 ,A,I'm kidding dude
10/9/22,14:30 ,A,Ferrari to protest the penalty
10/9/22,14:35 ,A,I heard it in post race interview
10/9/22,14:35 ,A,Don't know if they would change their mind
10/9/22,14:55 ,A,Are decisions swayed based off the country u are in ? I understand stewards change every race. Did they want to finish the championship in Japan on intention. Who knows. But Charles battled all the way with checo within a second. He can't go offtrack and keep position. He had to be second.. if this was early on in the race they'd let it slide
10/9/22,14:55 ,A,No radio at the end of the race.. feels odd. Need proper celebrations or atleast donuts
10/9/22,14:59 ,A,Charles and perez for P2 in championship
10/9/22,15:00 ,A,Separated by 1 point.
10/9/22,15:00 ,A,Max should just win in Austin with fastest lap and Christian on radio.. come on..
10/9/22,15:21 ,A,https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/754641540332257284/1028605475622748230/20221009_152048.jpg
10/9/22,15:22 ,A,This is bs
10/9/22,17:45 ,A,"This track only requires straight line speed. He should take a penalty , start last and finish 1st . Easy"
10/9/22,19:21 ,A,How much will the next season change. ? Will ferrari and mercedes close in on the pace deficit?
10/9/22,19:22 ,A,Rb already had an inferior car on a single lap pace this season
10/9/22,19:27 ,A,No race wins for merc this season
10/9/22,19:28 ,A,Rb will try everything for that
10/9/22,19:50 ,A,He's a good driver who needs a consistent car and strategy. Only then he has a chance for the championship
10/9/22,21:07 ,A,"Yup , the moment he reached parc ferme I noticed it.. he defended the best he could"
10/9/22,21:08 ,A,Poor setup for ferrari. No front grip
10/10/22,16:26 ,A,So another 3 hours
10/10/22,17:26 ,A,Still discussing masi are we?
10/10/22,17:29 ,A,Masi for the Haas seat
10/10/22,17:29 ,A,Best lineup
10/10/22,17:30 ,A,Will latifi try other racing formats ?
10/10/22,20:36 ,A,Deduct 112 points from max this season. Let's get racing.
10/10/22,20:38 ,A,Silverstone. Hamiltons fault. They needed an extra of everything 
10/10/22,20:39 ,A,With the profit they're raking this year. Pennies
10/10/22,20:41 ,A,Did they forget how much they paid under the table in 2019
10/10/22,20:41 ,A,Where did Charles get these poles from..
10/10/22,20:42 ,A,Adrian can just paint some Flo vis and and upgrade the car. Still win 
10/11/22,09:24 ,A,https://www.instagram.com/reel/CjiqP-_jvav/?igshid=ZjJiMWE1MWQ=
10/11/22,18:31 ,A,That's what's happened most likely.
10/11/22,18:32 ,A,Teams must have accruals. Cost centers for every department. A little complicated but it is possible
10/11/22,18:33 ,A,"An account with 145 million pounds , and u can only spend from that account.."
10/11/22,18:34 ,A,All nostro Vostro charges can be excluded
10/11/22,18:35 ,A,Well yea thats another discussion. Should u be including all that ? Why must salaried employees be fired. Is 145 enough.. all that jazz
10/11/22,18:36 ,A,"Also disclosing salaries, money for each part. All that should be tight knit. Is fia even capable to handle all that"
10/11/22,18:36 ,A,Hand it over to a custodian bank
10/11/22,18:37 ,A,God knows how they calculate everything
10/11/22,18:41 ,A,R&D ?
10/11/22,18:41 ,A,"Salaries, logistics"
10/11/22,18:42 ,A,That contract is fairly new. This isn't something that's the same for past 10 years
10/11/22,18:42 ,A,Loopholes
10/11/22,18:43 ,A,It's about pushing boundaries and finding margins
10/11/22,18:43 ,A,How else will cars go vroom
10/12/22,12:37 ,A,True. I looked up and they announced at the bottom of the screen with a headline saying max champion. So confusing..
10/12/22,12:37 ,A,He went back in the cooldown room still not believing he won.. so weird. Austin would have been amazing to announce it..
10/12/22,17:12 ,A,Them letting us know it's just going to be a few million dollars in fine.
10/12/22,19:49 ,A,
8/6/22,15:10 ,B,This is so good
8/6/22,15:11 ,B,Crazy skill to imitate voices and accents like that
8/6/22,18:40 ,B,Vrum Brum
8/6/22,19:06 ,B,Yeh he is pretty quick
8/6/22,19:06 ,B,Like George won everything back in his time
8/6/22,21:54 ,B,"Yeh, Hamilton could have won so many races, like break seb record and all but he was sleeping (jk boys)"
8/6/22,22:51 ,B,"""But that's because they have more races now and race in different places """
8/6/22,22:51 ,B,Still crazy
8/6/22,22:51 ,B,Max Singapore win when ?
8/6/22,23:57 ,B,Charles can still win
8/6/22,23:57 ,B,But Ferrari can't mess up
8/7/22,00:08 ,B,Brothers think with me
8/7/22,00:08 ,B,"First is 25 points, second is 17 (I think)"
8/7/22,00:08 ,B,So 7 points diference
8/7/22,00:08 ,B,7*9=63
8/7/22,00:08 ,B,"So if max doesn't always finish second, it is still possible"
8/7/22,00:15 ,B,"Bruh, at least the calculation was right "
8/7/22,03:51 ,B,Ahahaha so true
8/7/22,18:12 ,B,Nah
8/7/22,18:13 ,B,He can wait 600000 years for redbull seat
8/7/22,18:13 ,B,He is still young
8/7/22,23:14 ,B,Lel
8/7/22,23:14 ,B,If you are homeless just buy a house
8/7/22,23:14 ,B,Is way more complex than it
8/8/22,01:16 ,B,It's streaming in the official site brother
8/8/22,01:16 ,B,I think
8/8/22,05:02 ,B,What happened to Romain ?
8/8/22,05:02 ,B,He started P2 finished p14
8/8/22,05:02 ,B,Ah what a sheme
8/8/22,15:32 ,B,FEA
8/9/22,01:45 ,B,"Mate, this is your best one so far, crazy job man, looks so sick. The light, the reflexes, the overall design. Crazy job man. You have some real tallent man keep going."
8/9/22,02:33 ,B,Do you have a site or something ? Where you show your designs and all that stuff ?
8/9/22,03:05 ,B,Buy asseto Corsa competizione 
8/9/22,03:05 ,B,Wait for steam sales
8/9/22,03:45 ,B,Yes
8/9/22,03:45 ,B,You have some dlcs of tracks if you want
8/9/22,03:47 ,B,"There are using league races with for example 8 races (2 tracks are dlc) but only the 6 best races count for the championship, so you don't need to buy the dlc. But obviously if you buy it you get an advantage. But it depends, play the game, get used to it, choose a cool car for your taste, and then practice with it, it will be your best friend. My best friend is the McLaren 720s gt3, mega oversteery but very strong in medium to high speed corners."
8/9/22,03:47 ,B,"Then try league racing, and buy the dlcs you need/ like for the races"
8/9/22,14:10 ,B,Grande kimi
8/9/22,19:39 ,B,Could be more
8/9/22,19:39 ,B,Not today bas
8/9/22,19:39 ,B,21 mil for piastri
8/9/22,22:55 ,B,Jinxed
8/11/22,18:58 ,B,"Nah, it will comeback soon"
8/11/22,18:58 ,B,It's just one year off
8/11/22,23:46 ,B,Ferrari can't have a break
8/11/22,23:46 ,B,Can't have a brake
8/12/22,14:01 ,B,People like this don't deserve anything
8/12/22,14:02 ,B,Couldn't agree more
8/12/22,14:17 ,B,The coencil has decided his faith
8/13/22,03:27 ,B,Let me guess ? F1 twitter?
8/13/22,03:27 ,B,"Caus I don't think there is much hate towards Zhou, at least from my side, me and the boys love Zhou "
8/13/22,03:47 ,B,"I just realized twitters algorithm is completely horrible, istead of showing the comments with most likes/ comments first, it shows the ones with like no likes and only comments (the ones that cause drama) I saw a post with like 20 comments all of them were garbage, and the only one with like 80 likes was at the bottom of everything and I needed to click show this comment to see it, what a shame."
8/13/22,03:48 ,B,"Plus if you go to a famous twitter, the first comment will probably have like 20 likes in a 500k likes post."
8/13/22,03:49 ,B,I believe that's what makes twitter so toxic at the moment
8/13/22,14:57 ,B,https://youtu.be/OocvlVbzRUo
8/13/22,14:57 ,B,(the video of the crash
8/13/22,17:54 ,B,I hope small rain in quali
8/13/22,17:54 ,B,But not in the race
8/13/22,19:02 ,B,"Yes, everybody though there were cameramans on the ground"
8/13/22,19:08 ,B,Sus
8/13/22,19:46 ,B,Bruh
8/13/22,19:47 ,B,Who is amus ?
8/13/22,19:47 ,B,Amogus ?
8/13/22,21:50 ,B,"Link , I am Gunther Steiner I am the one that knows "
8/13/22,21:50 ,B,Let me check the news if something is out yet
8/13/22,22:11 ,B,Time for real slicks
8/13/22,22:11 ,B,And real rain tyres
8/13/22,22:15 ,B,I only found this
8/13/22,22:15 ,B,https://formula1news.co.uk/ex-f1-driver-claims-daniel-ricciardo-will-move-to-haas-as-silly-season-kicks-off/
8/13/22,22:15 ,B,But it's just a rumour

8/15/22,01:08 ,B,"Real, roads are just tracks but bigger"
8/15/22,01:09 ,B,Nurburgring is the biggest PRIVATE track
8/15/22,01:09 ,B,The real track is the road 
8/15/22,01:10 ,B,"Police is the safety car, but instead of being behind you need to be in front off them"
8/15/22,01:11 ,B,British roads are so good you get porpoising even without floor effect

8/19/22,15:15 ,B,"Seb didn't know that Kimi was there, if Kimi wasn't there it would be fine, but Ferrari didn't had the engine to compete in the remaining circuits"
8/20/22,22:52 ,B,"He was very good, he break the nurburgring record on the warmup lap, then he crashed on his second lap, that's why he has his eye a little bit sleepy."
8/21/22,01:45 ,B,28
8/21/22,01:45 ,B,Just joking hahaha
8/21/22,02:46 ,B,It depends on the driving style
8/21/22,02:46 ,B,For me I prefer oversteer and a pointy front
8/21/22,02:46 ,B,A front that turns in
8/21/22,02:47 ,B,"If the rear is unstable I can use it in my favour to rotate the car, but it can betray you sometimes and the car is more unstable."
8/21/22,02:48 ,B,"Understeer the car is more stable, it requires a different type of driving style."
8/21/22,02:59 ,B,"True, seb never liked rear unstable cars, that's why he struggled with the 2014 redbull and 2020 Ferrari"
8/21/22,02:59 ,B,Both cars were rear limited
8/21/22,02:59 ,B,Seb likes a precise front with a stable rear
8/21/22,02:59 ,B,Alonso drives anything they give him haha

8/22/22,16:03 ,B,Zandvoort
8/22/22,16:04 ,B,"Both qualifyings were amazing, but he was unlucky in lap 1 o both"
8/22/22,16:04 ,B,"He could have finished maybe top 5 on those races, but yeh, unlucky"
8/22/22,18:40 ,B,Don't forget the crazy antibodies
8/22/22,18:41 ,B,Maybe it's time for seb to return
8/22/22,18:41 ,B,He should have waited in 2020 to sign for redbill
8/22/22,18:42 ,B,It would be crazy lineup
8/22/22,18:42 ,B,In 1923
8/22/22,22:20 ,B,Only 200 M ?

8/29/22,22:45 ,B,"Put a microphone on the football guys, 99% of what they say it's super super offensive."

8/25/22,15:44 ,C,"I get what your saying that would look better, but for some reason I could never seem to like this livery"
8/25/22,15:44 ,C,For me the best Mercedes livery ever is 2019

8/25/22,15:50 ,C,Ohh I see

8/25/22,15:54 ,C,I didnt like the 2019 Williams that livery was horrid
8/25/22,15:54 ,C,Well everything about Williams in 2019 was horrid
