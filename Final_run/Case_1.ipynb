       "'Piastri has dominated everything he has done earlier. From F4 to f2 Wc in all categories Would definitely learn this new car faster W11 was a beast Rocket on rails Will never happen sadly In all this chaos u forget u are still aiming to drive at the pinnacle of the sport. Maybe these guys know that they could get a seat in other formats of racing. Also he\\'s loaded already. It\\'s not an L , just disappointment ig They should announce it already.  What I meant is. He\\'s already competing at the highest level in racing. But fighting for more/wins. Didn\\'t say it\\'s disappointing. He can always do something else if there is situation where no one signs him. For people like us , feeling bad for daniel not being in formula 1 is stupid.. he is in this position due to his own choices. It\\'s disappointing he\\'s not at the top anymore winning like before. How long is this summer break Kimi https://nypost.com/2022/08/09/ferrari-recalls-17-years-worth-of-cars-over-possible-brake-failure/amp/ Why r fans even using Twitter. Nothing good ever comes from that platform  Even Chris medland posts are put here by pranav and others. Id prefer such groups and Instagram anyday. Had to be either a mercedes or a rb fan no wonder elon is hesitating to buy  Hope no rain this year.. should be a good race Is he talking about himself  Maybe one day when lewis retires they could be better friends  Mercedes have won for so long they got very cocky very soon. It\\'s time Ferrari and rb come back up again. Does max prefer oversteer ? Heard this somewhere long ago I mean a little bit.. Since last season his cars rears tend to slide around , visually atleast.. Interesting. At first I thought he doesn\\'t have the right balance but he keeps winning with this setup Maybe even gets more temp on tyres that way considering the sliding around Let\\'s gooo Atleast now they must announce about piastri Raining this weekend at spa wtf ? Both days  https://youtu.be/txP754Hy3pA I swear. Thursday is press con. Lot of updates i believe , should be worth it. Friday fp1 Jesus is back in Haas. New track reveal So just one more day What? I thout spa ! Ah well. He\\'s won multiple times and was once a rb driver.. and the big personality or else yeah.. One Baku race and imola vs seb and this driver dive bombs. Alpine is his best choice Must be running his tattoo  Rubbing* They know questions will be asked about it tomorrow. Might as well reveal it beforehand They\\'d wait until end of season as otmar has made it a legal issue for piastri Until that\\'s sorted.. they can\\'t announce Rb did not fuck up with their car. They were using Renault engines which were failing frequently. And Daniel chose to go with them instead. Was he poached ? Yes. Christian didn\\'t want him to go. Rb were not ready clearly. They tried their luck with gasly albon in the coming years. Yeah i get a feeling max would relax after 2 titles.. but u never know. I read and watched every interview he gave after Abu Dhabi last year and every statement he gave, he had no intentions fully, like 100% to come and win again. But here we are , he knows he has a car.. and he\\'s going for it.. I even noticed max seemed to have gained weight this season.. lol this is totally based on photos.. I\\'m not sure.. but he looks different The pressure was unreal. Lewis did not make it easy. This season its so calm. nope, what is it ? reduced weight ? Yeah the black sweater is  Max looks Mexican https://youtu.be/_MLzH-stpcc Audi x sauber Niceeee. Brackley So yeah Germany would be first. Rbpt UK Milton Keynes. Porsche is next  How long until fp1 Guys I have a silly question. So Audi will manufacture the power unit. The engine also right ? Or since the specifications for the engine is same for all cars. Meaning 1.6l 1000bhp , it\\'s standard ? Is the engine \"standard\" same ? Or manufacturers like mercedes Ferrari rbpt make changes Like i get all drive the V6 hybrid. Is the hybrid part the only difference ? So true True again. nan Gravel And some beautiful strat from ferrari Perfect combination It\\'s raining still Lewis was 11th in fp3 doubt it. Yeah no tyre temps that\\'s all I heard too. Hope it\\'s a dry quali Stroll for pole  13 mins Raining nan What was dangerous with tsunoda ? So everyone has the new floor from this race right ? Pushed it all the way ig Perez on pole What what what Did they fuckup his tyres So no fresh ones for the actual race ? Broo He could let\\'s wait Driving on Slow mode Feel bad for charles. Sergio time deleted ? Smart to save tyres rb Unlike Ferrari Slow down lap. Nvm Still lost time.. tow didn\\'t work Yeah perez better be on pole now Wtf is it max on pole from the pit They are worse than before.. what havoc I even took a picture of it nan 8 years this must the biggest gap They tolerate him at this point. Either of the mercs mess with a McLaren or alpine . That\\'s my wild prediction..  . I\\'m borderline nervous with every driver on the grid suggesting that \" oh let\\'s see how far off we finish from max \" his pace was incredible sure.. but there are fewer laps today in the entire race. 43 ? Ig.. sure he will overtake a few cars but anything can happen Also he took pole from the pits , when was the last time we saw that ? 6 tenths ahead. In 1 run. Didn\\'t even wait for track evolution Yeah they are so confident about their package. Mainly because max dominated the practice sessions also.. Leclerc was nowhere close.. he\\'s got a new pu also Yeah sure. It\\'s more or less the same.. rb has got the top speed to comfortably lead So much.. only safety cars could give them a competitive edge.. and some really good strategy.. But merc look slow. So atleast one Ferrari driver gets podium Fernando can be top 5 When was the last time he started with a penalty ? He didn\\'t even finish top 5 i believe. Canada p5 He started p20 Yup New pu for yuki He deserves a seat next year Lol Told yal Yeah it\\'s okay.. lewis fault Fuck that Perez better be awake Fernando no damage it seems Glad Too ambitious Generally he waits Oh the memes What is max on!!!! It\\'s like everyone else is driving F2 cars Lewis dnf. Who will they penalise ? Are they forcing Sainz to pit Yeah it worked Pressure from both bulls Ferrari pits George.. wow.. Respecccc Max in drs  They\\'re afraid  It\\'s best to let drivers decide on strategy Righhttt good for him Vettel p7 pretty good for aston What did max say ? Why isn\\'t Leclerc pushing.. new components How can they not catch a mercedes ! They\\'ve even given him mediums He admits.. good job Damn baguette What a move nan Lol this is a joke Stealing fastest lap from who and for what ? Why did he slide like that Scary Max got the fastest lap Charles Leclerc speeding in pitlane But not on track Whatttttt 5 sec Nando p5 Brooooo Legends  Charles should move to mercedes that\\'s enough Lewis retires Charles in This is bullshit.. waste of his talent.. At this rate max wins a race or two early. So p6 right Who was 7 8 Fernando was pointing fingers at lewis in the safety car lap.. lol Fernando was sprayed with oil after the crash.. Luckily it was lap 1 so I don\\'t think it was hot.. True Just imagining ways a F1 driver can get hurt.. it\\'s crazy Lewis could have engine damage. Or something that serves him a penalty in future Man was elevated If they were sponsored by oil giants and automobile constructor\\'s maybe they would  Charles was 81kmph Just 1 kmph extra In the pitlane A bit harsh on the penalty. Mario kart Haha yeah TD hurt the Ferrari more than rb it seems..? They can\\'t be so off the pace especially with new components Is that a neck brace Records are meant to be broken With more races per year it was supposed to happen Not really.. max lewis bottas were looking good last year Are u p9 or p10 - question It\\'s happening  https://www.instagram.com/reel/ChfWqfJD17C/?igshid=MDJmNzVkMjY= This season doesn\\'t even come close to last year Every race was incredible Silly season indeed. Nope. There was an actual battle on lap 1 every race ! Both merc and rb had good strategies and had a plan of action. It was super competitive. Also masi made it so interesting with the penalties and decisions. Every race someone shared 10 PDFs in this group chat on news from the FIA Ferrari has given up for the season. It\\'s just preparation for next season now. Bro. Max had a lot of poor starts , lewis was on it. Everyone just prayed they didn\\'t touch wheels. Yes battle ! Time to fit in the Brazil power unit  From last year George would be in contention of a championship battle before Leclerc if merc are stronger next season So consistent New car, regs.. always managing well.. Would like that honestly New car since he came from a Williams. Although he had driven it before.. If mercedes had the same car this season. Who would win.. ferrari or mercedes With lewis and George. And all the experience they bring Do u see them making the same mistakes Yeah but u get the point right.. If mercedes find the deficit pace next year. It\\'s merc vs rb again Lewis will be on and off podiums Let\\'s see , i don\\'t see him winning another championship. I could be wrong but doesn\\'t seem like he would now... With everyone elbows out and a fairly descent car.. Extremely good car.. like the rb Can\\'t blame him. He\\'s always driven a near perfect car last 5 seasons Only a certain tracks didn\\'t suit them.. or else they were always pushing and in podiums Check lewis insta story. Someone called him an idiot. Mans hurt  That Ferrari intiative against cyber bullying and racist comments is a month old now.. he shared it again to make a point obviously Fia* Should delete Ferrari  what nonsense autocorrect  Schumacher leaving Ferrari ? Confirmed i guess Well, he took the L in his username Someone\\'s crashing for sure They will announce tomorrow right ? Alpine regarding next year Media isn\\'t dumb it\\'s clickbait Even if Oscar loses this case. How is it possible that alpine take him. Will he be on good terms with otmar. ? I can\\'t believe a scenario if they win, they keep him.. it\\'s just about the money I believe Can\\'t take money from him and ask him to be ur driver.  Gasly to alpine muscle  Max verstappen is now an officer Sir lewis , officer max nan nan https://youtu.be/9Tk77M54KxM Gasly to alpine. Mic to alpha tauri So they reduce speed but not cause gravel to be on track Is that correct ? Resin like material. ? Interesting. Full throttle banking with drs . So just make it easier for max effectively How long until fp1 We want smoke  Beach is so close. Should be windy anyway Yes! Races get cancelled or moved , they don\\'t update. Same issue. I ask for timings here  Transmission smoked In his 3rd lap ig. Didn\\'t do any further runs. Clearly. Bothered merc,Ferrari, maybe haas instead. Alpine  doing well Lol so otmar gets no compensation ? They should get him on the radio in fp2 Hotstar issue anyone ? It was live sometime ago  Yes  Delayed He knows he\\'s good. Also backed by good sponsors. Has won almost every championship he\\'s been a part of. With alpine , he did an internship. Job offer from McLaren He must have noticed something in alpine , or the money who knows. But yea I get ur point.. he was an investment from alpines end. Fair point Were they planning to make him a reserve driver ? J.Button said it\\'s too early for piastri to be making F1 enemies this early. Saw the whole thing.. he was grilled with questions Who gets pole I think Charles or sainz  Max had it difficult throughout.. What is this quali  Ikr! pretty much the wind affecting the speeds and gaps now He gave up on his lap Super. Merc look strong here Might just outpace ferrari Idiots Could ruin a lap, damage a car. It\\'s the best gp to be at arguably I\\'m terms of experience Mate i don\\'t know.. just repeating what I heard from max and Daniels performance coach. On a pod This is more like a festival too. Party scenes and Dutch are known to have good music festivals. Closer to Amsterdam This guy is on another level Let\\'s go maxxx  Yeah i think lewis had to let go of the throttle But ferrari brought their A game in q3 Is this edited or real? At this rate they will have another circuit in America and scrap a european circuit I never liked Jeddah so much Cool setup No we want a good fight till the end. I reckon they stop twice Softs won\\'t last Hamilton on mediums . Bold move Looks very dark test What the fuckkkkk He was on the cable ??? Penalty!!! Yeah! What if the tyre gets damaged So careless Seb and Mick were probably chatting next to eachother  Safety car will change everything Will max pit Safety car now pls  Come on latifi Perez defence come on!! Niceee Let\\'s hear a crying radio now He shows up !! Did as much as he could. Lol seb  He had nowhere to go  seb investigation nan Let\\'s gooo nan Fuuuuu Rb should pit  Stopping !! Yeayyyy let\\'s goo Come. On Charles? Why is he not going vroom Ocon  Yuki happened Lot of penalties tonight Another one Valterri it\\'s james Most dng this season i think from valterri If u count practice also Softs let\\'s goo Broo nan I hope this is good Car is basically in qualifying condition Low fuel Almost new softs Ham pits Chaossss I need to see the highlights Idk what is happening anymore Is ferrari even in the championship Penalty night Lapped cars trauma And lewis is P1  Is he right behind me On new tyres Rb has the pace come on!! 12 laps Loooooll They want the 2-3 Waved him bye Finishing ahead of Ferrari. Still a good day for them What could merc do more ??? Man big F for ferrari Imagine We have Nico on the radio today lol He wanted softs ?? What is he crying about nan Sainz didn\\'t slow under yellows , unsafe release.. Not even top 10 He was almost pole She cute  At this point looking at the floods in Pak. They need the win. https://www.instagram.com/p/CiDmpN4hw2X/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y= As expected it\\'s a penalty night.. Many drivers called to stewards Binotto will never accept fault Only pace an issue according to ferrari Interesting thing is.. this is kinda like Abu Dhabi.. rb trust max and his ability to overtake.. they sacrifice his track position and make him pit for softs.. whereas lewis on mediums.. yet again stays out. Imagine these theories if it was gasly instead of latifi last year, last race. TG it was a Williams  Colton is taking his seat, he\\'s going alpine next year. We should know by next week Who got fastest lap Who is willeard nan I guess as per the starting grid position it\\'s not considered? What a beautiful answer He\\'s really championship material  It\\'s simple. If u make fun of lewis or max. In a way ur suggesting that the other driver has no talent and wins only because of the car.. respect between competitors is necessary. Or ur fav driver is like any other driver. I\\'m yet to hear hamilton saying max has driven well this season.. he knows it. He won\\'t say it.. max has no ego admitting it. Since the start of the season hamilton has said it\\'s the car. The redbull \" car \" is fast. When we all know the deficit between max and perez. Let\\'s say it\\'s 50-50 and move on. Or else , daniel would have a seat today He better finish P2 in the championship U also share  But he doesn\\'t have a good reason as excuse for the decisions his team makes. Or its too private for the rest of us She giggled between a pressure situation, toxic fans hated that.. Also has been doing a steller job in strategy so is quite in the limelight. Unacceptable behaviour This message was deleted I think we need a safety car  Let it go guys. This is not why this group was made. We have Twitter for this. Last season the steward drama made it interesting ngl Except the toxicity between fans Good suspense towards the end Staying up late at night to read a pdf from fia If he finishes in points would be legit fun Hope it rains.  I mean he did he say he was confused He\\'s never won monza 5th at best. Last year rb had the pace for a podium atleast.. but they messed up with his pit stop, his outlap was slow And then we all know what happened Ferrari could be lucky with the yellow or super unlucky , fingers crossed Have to be.  They are taking a step backwards every race He is sick Max too right ? Oh nvm Is this the last change until the end of season ? I doubt reliability are still major concerns at rb. Why the frequent changes Maybe so.. i hope the reasons are for the better Monza is easy overtaking on the straights. He can finish 1st with pitlane start. Not worried Meh Drs train issue is very midfield specific P1 to p5 not an issue Can ferrari win this  1:22:4 is good! Soon we will say \"are rb sandbagging\"  I mean it could be.. their fresh new engine blew up in Bahrain Maybe it\\'s some conservative mode Mercedes  https://youtu.be/-1zFzWPNcqo so nyck has driven 3 different cars in the last few months aston mercedes and williams Schumacher ocon magnussen max perez lewis Penalty Who else   another day another max pole Still gets the tyre And the record ? Is that in the books https://youtu.be/qTVtutHv7eA Yes They\\'ve turned it on for the car exhaust audio Ferrari go brrr 1-2 Rb missing a few tenths McLaren competitive Ferrari rear wing working.. good for them Medium stint rb is faster Only way to win this Especially for overtakes u need a fast car on mediums This is not correct right ? How\\'s max p4 With a 5 place grid penalty 2+5 p7 no? So many penalties  How long until race 6.30 ist right ? P3 already Maxxxx Perez  So unfortunate If the fire doesn\\'t go out He will Break bias now -2 I think it\\'s not.. but let\\'s see Towards they end that medium will suffer.. Nha he\\'s using engine breaking Instead of heating the breaks Lol maxs gf yawning in the back  Should max pit for soft Bro Leclerc is already on soft And he is catching max soon. Old sets ? Damn.. should have given him mediums then Race won\\'t resume ig Max Sainz new rest old Nicee Scrub soft gp said on radio Clutch disengages gear no?? Oh ok Perez gotta do what max did last year Nicee Same number of dnfs as Abu Dhabi right ? Boooooringgg Nyck  Max would have won this either way.. who are we kidding..  No mate.. not even close. Yeah exactly.. 17+ seconds He wasn\\'t catching max either way.. So deserving.. Eat Daniels he won\\'t need them  Like it will bother them at this point  It has begun I read a board in the crowd binnotto out So they hate him as much as we do  Red plus yellow is orange.  Thanks tifosi nan Ferrari strat good.. but not great. This race was a snooze fest Compared to last year Ferrari was not competitive on race pace.. others were just slower than them. So Singapore dnf for charles..  True. But I hope atleast mercedes find some pace to challenge max. Max has had a faultless season It was over by now  So ideally he gets Williams seat first and then graduates to mercedes shit Hope he makes fulls recovery Why didnt fia red flag the race. ? Ending behind a safety car not fun Just red flag it then. Last 10 laps if a car breaks down in a tough spot. Red flag , coz I guess adding more laps would be a fuel and weight concern Well this needs to change. U get sporting regulations or entertainment.. middle ground is to keep both parties happy. Anyway max was faster , wouldn\\'t have mattered but still.. He should have red flagged it Lewis and max both get fresh tyres Would have been fair Why so ? If u have them use them Ferrari actually fucked up on strategy. It just doesn\\'t look as bad since we expect the worst already. I watched the post race show. They were suffering from high deg already They made poor choices yesterday also Why just Charles and max.. think about George perez. Lewis.. This isn\\'t about P1 only Fair Tell this to lewis..  Either he doesn\\'t pit or he hates the idea of drivers gaining an advantage from red flags.. Jeddah, turkey are just examples of it. Hungary also I think Knowing that u have a faster car and a driver like lewis.. they should take such risks He\\'s here to stay in the sport for another two years minimum.. Next year its three way battle Ferrari will have better reliability hopefully and perform on specific tracks.. rb will be in the mix always since they are already few tenths up. Mercedes will improve. Still is.. Russell is the faster than lewis this year.. he\\'s adapted to the car better than lewis imo. Just based of the number of years spent in F1 and a new team for him.. Russell is doing a mega job driving a bouncy car. I see him winning a championship atleast once if he has the car So consistent Just watching videos from last season. Max looks lean His face has stress all over it.. or maybe he just gained some weight this season.. But he looked different.. That\\'s the thing right.. u need that agression for a championship.. Charles is soft Can u say that given the same car , Charles vs lewis.. last year.. Can charles win ? Tough to say When his contract ends he\\'s going to mercedes  Hulk n kmag in Haas !?  Balls will be sucked  This can be a nice printer ad HP should pick it up What  Oh yeah! Same font has the one below. Definitely fake Instagram crashed ? Is it working for you guys He means Austin ? Audi x Alfa Romeo ? Brooklyn Beckhams ex 3 tens Perez with reliability issue ? Lewis Happened behind him, he didn\\'t slow down Yea someone will crash tonight Lol y I have to say I would be to. He\\'s already guilty before anything is proven. March 2022 they submitted the accounts, it took them this long to come up with these accusations ? Who even started them ? Every social media account is naming aston and rb to have had exceeded the cap. Espnf1, autosport. Everyone.. Toto also not holding back with his comments.  nan That amg looks sick in the rain It has a special floor Exactly  Did ferrari forget what they do in 2019 Merc i understand they salty Charles  engine issues nan This again No But it could They r going out on inters  Max still winning this  If it\\'s dry and clean without SC issues No doubt he gets it done.  I mean fans asked for it.. I read a comment on the max outburst when he was asked to box. \" No budget for the fuel anymore \"  Delayed ?? What??!!? Why? Bruhh Not working this works thanks bru  whenn It\\'s still the formation lap Are they repairing ? Hotstar is a dick. Think their contract only allows them to show the main race. Thanks for link  Singapore never finishes under the time limit. I read somewhere.. It always exceeds the time limit 2hr plus. 26 mins until lights out.. To Russell He crashed bottas Brilliant Max should have had a better start. Whoaaa Finally some entertainment This battl should be interesting BnO flat pls Flag* 2.8 Daniel  Free stop nan Let\\'s go Lando.. Whyyyy The heat got to his head or what Now lewis and max  Softs.. come on!!!! Perez doing a mega job . Man max fucked up This is. On him Win was not possible but p5-p6 was easy Ik ik When lewis had inters in first half of the race. \" Wrong tyre c1.txt c2.txt cleaned.txt media media.cpp outfile1.txt test test.cpp WhatsApp Chat with F1 - Copy.txt wow.sh Now with mediums.. wrong tyre What does he want  nan Finish ahead of hamilton now max.. Let\\'s gooo Give us fans something  No one noticed aston in 6-7 Lol Hahaha Break test the car behind  Vet ham verstappen. Wow Perez imo Vettel Max doesn\\'t have grip or what.. drs train.. They\\'re betting on him to get penalised ig Yaaaassssssss nan nan Ham got ptsd nan 7.6 Street circuit  Places his car well. Defends like a champ Maxxx!!! Let\\'s goooo Could have been a 1-2. Ferrari dropped pace towards the end nan Rb 1-2 and it\\'s over. Mexican national anthem was looong.. Just like this race Nicholas got a grid penalty for japan Wtf  5 place  https://youtu.be/zrCIuUkFO3M Ham fined 25k$ For the nose stud Slightly worried Heart rate go brrrrr nan UPDATE: The FIA wont conclude analysis of financial submissions today. New date given is Monday 10 October #F1 It\\'s raining  Everybody talks here as if they work with fia  and have the audited bills. Relax U know only what\\'s been disclosed by media, rb representatives And rumours from different sources. The entire contract can be read in different ways by law. If not worded correctly. The contract is never public information. So everybody calm down. Obviously. After checo leaves double Dutch delight Haas is taking time. They would probably disclose something in Austin. Decide when the dust settles in the driver market. Steiner wants someone experienced, so don\\'t expect a rookie joining. Williams will have a rookie most probably. ? It\\'s wrong why the  We have a dry quali Reserve role most likely.. Haas will get someone like hulkenberg Maybe Williams  Bruh what\\'s ferrari doing with Charles car Who isn\\'t..  he deserves it Well, we will see next year Rb has Activated v tec flyiny Yea first run on mediums Vet  nan sergiooooo 4 tens up!! Aloo Just made it Locked up Race pace should be good Fuck That was scary Putting heat in tyres Idk what made him do that Yea he slowed down for a gap between him and rb.. then went full speed Yeah it\\'s fine. As it was an outlap.. had it been a quali run it should have been a grid penalty for sure.. Lol yeah Think he could have gone faster in sector 1 Fml Weight reduced  Diffuser broke Towards a British driver u mean Lando and max are . No investigation necessary  Latifis fault Even with a 5 place grid penalty max can pass the competition. Did anyone improve on their final run ? Hope the damage to the car isn\\'t big and can be repaired in parc ferme Wet race 100% We won\\'t see slicks today Crofty  Facts We know he\\'s good in wets Holyyyyyy Ballssss Maxxx Sainzzz Noo Bruhhh Lap 1 ladies and gentlemen Vet no damage right ? 10 mins Max opening fifa packs Why was gasly so angry Someone tweet at karun Rolling start 15 min Not raining anymore Are we gonna get full points should be the question Did they forget about jules Learnt nothing from it. So much for safety. nan If this was pre 2015 we would have started stay positive guys  Sprint race pls Don\\'t call it off https://twitter.com/bdotsenol/status/1578995810037280768?t=hLm0Z9-QKAv7C7WhYMAAwA&s=08 1 hr to go I must say even with this weather. Japanese people have their spirits up. Still smiling and celebrating Racee resumes let\\'s goooo Latifi should win this  Mick clearing water for everyone LEC has fastest lap since past 5 mins. Still the gap is increasing between him and max How ?! Ah right.. Damn ocon defending for life Hoping for Race wins. Perez s message to europe nan Russell would have gone past baguette by now Ham not in his element Ocon also just v good Nando pits Come on checooo Oooo almost yeah This should be like football. +5 over time  What a race Perez p2 Alonso overtake must be insane They didn\\'t show it though Leclerc tyres look like slicks fuck Ocon dotd LEC under investigation 5 sec penalty Perez p2 Confirm Yess Official P3 Lfgoooooooo Let\\'s savour the moment All questions will be cleared Cry nan I\\'m kidding dude Ferrari to protest the penalty I heard it in post race interview Don\\'t know if they would change their mind Are decisions swayed based off the country u are in ? I understand stewards change every race. Did they want to finish the championship in Japan on intention. Who knows. But Charles battled all the way with checo within a second. He can\\'t go offtrack and keep position. He had to be second.. if this was early on in the race they\\'d let it slide No radio at the end of the race.. feels odd. Need proper celebrations or atleast donuts Charles and perez for P2 in championship Separated by 1 point. Max should just win in Austin with fastest lap and Christian on radio.. come on.. https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/754641540332257284/1028605475622748230/20221009_152048.jpg This is bs This track only requires straight line speed. He should take a penalty , start last and finish 1st . Easy How much will the next season change. ? Will ferrari and mercedes close in on the pace deficit? Rb already had an inferior car on a single lap pace this season No race wins for merc this season Rb will try everything for that He\\'s a good driver who needs a consistent car and strategy. Only then he has a chance for the championship Yup , the moment he reached parc ferme I noticed it.. he defended the best he could Poor setup for ferrari. No front grip So another 3 hours Still discussing masi are we? Masi for the Haas seat Best lineup Will latifi try other racing formats ? Deduct 112 points from max this season. Let\\'s get racing. Silverstone. Hamiltons fault. They needed an extra of everything  With the profit they\\'re raking this year. Pennies Did they forget how much they paid under the table in 2019 Where did Charles get these poles from.. Adrian can just paint some Flo vis and and upgrade the car. Still win  https://www.instagram.com/reel/CjiqP-_jvav/?igshid=ZjJiMWE1MWQ= That\\'s what\\'s happened most likely. Teams must have accruals. Cost centers for every department. A little complicated but it is possible An account with 145 million pounds , and u can only spend from that account.. All nostro Vostro charges can be excluded Well yea thats another discussion. Should u be including all that ? Why must salaried employees be fired. Is 145 enough.. all that jazz Also disclosing salaries, money for each part. All that should be tight knit. Is fia even capable to handle all that Hand it over to a custodian bank God knows how they calculate everything R&D ? Salaries, logistics That contract is fairly new. This isn\\'t something that\\'s the same for past 10 years Loopholes It\\'s about pushing boundaries and finding margins How else will cars go vroom True. I looked up and they announced at the bottom of the screen with a headline saying max champion. So confusing.. He went back in the cooldown room still not believing he won.. so weird. Austin would have been amazing to announce it.. Them letting us know it\\'s just going to be a few million dollars in fine. nan This is so good Crazy skill to imitate voices and accents like that Vrum Brum Yeh he is pretty quick Like George won everything back in his time Yeh, Hamilton could have won so many races, like break seb record and all but he was sleeping (jk boys) \"But that\\'s because they have more races now and race in different places \" Still crazy Max Singapore win when ? Charles can still win But Ferrari can\\'t mess up Brothers think with me First is 25 points, second is 17 (I think) So 7 points diference 7*9=63 So if max doesn\\'t always finish second, it is still possible Bruh, at least the calculation was right  Ahahaha so true Nah He can wait 600000 years for redbull seat He is still young Lel If you are homeless just buy a house Is way more complex than it It\\'s streaming in the official site brother I think What happened to Romain ? He started P2 finished p14 Ah what a sheme FEA Mate, this is your best one so far, crazy job man, looks so sick. The light, the reflexes, the overall design. Crazy job man. You have some real tallent man keep going. Do you have a site or something ? Where you show your designs and all that stuff ? Buy asseto Corsa competizione  Wait for steam sales Yes You have some dlcs of tracks if you want There are using league races with for example 8 races (2 tracks are dlc) but only the 6 best races count for the championship, so you don\\'t need to buy the dlc. But obviously if you buy it you get an advantage. But it depends, play the game, get used to it, choose a cool car for your taste, and then practice with it, it will be your best friend. My best friend is the McLaren 720s gt3, mega oversteery but very strong in medium to high speed corners. Then try league racing, and buy the dlcs you need/ like for the races Grande kimi Could be more Not today bas 21 mil for piastri Jinxed Nah, it will comeback soon It\\'s just one year off Ferrari can\\'t have a break Can\\'t have a brake People like this don\\'t deserve anything Couldn\\'t agree more The coencil has decided his faith Let me guess ? F1 twitter? Caus I don\\'t think there is much hate towards Zhou, at least from my side, me and the boys love Zhou  I just realized twitters algorithm is completely horrible, istead of showing the comments with most likes/ comments first, it shows the ones with like no likes and only comments (the ones that cause drama) I saw a post with like 20 comments all of them were garbage, and the only one with like 80 likes was at the bottom of everything and I needed to click show this comment to see it, what a shame. Plus if you go to a famous twitter, the first comment will probably have like 20 likes in a 500k likes post. I believe that\\'s what makes twitter so toxic at the moment https://youtu.be/OocvlVbzRUo (the video of the crash I hope small rain in quali But not in the race Yes, everybody though there were cameramans on the ground Sus Bruh Who is amus ? Amogus ? Link , I am Gunther Steiner I am the one that knows  Let me check the news if something is out yet Time for real slicks And real rain tyres I only found this https://formula1news.co.uk/ex-f1-driver-claims-daniel-ricciardo-will-move-to-haas-as-silly-season-kicks-off/ But it\\'s just a rumour Personally i don\\'t think it\\'s true But this article was 10 days ago Vrum vrum Yeh the problem is They need a lot of braking zones to recharge the bactery They need to put real technology in an fE car 2000HP Go vrum But that\\'s not when racing hahahaha But still, put rimac bacteries to have 2000 HP True Really ? Rimac more like lowrangemac WORL CHAMPION Real You don\\'t need appearances to look atractive Most people that have gf/ cute girlfriends are not attractive Posture/ confidence is everything Yes that\\'s why we have kids Yo what Bro I thought you were talking his noose was the size of a baguette I wasn\\'t understanding anything haha It\\'s an f2 car hahaha But yes, very cool He is living the dream Bruh If I had 9999999 million, I would do the same Car go brr I would try to legalize one but it would be impossible in Europe, maybe in the USA you legalize it in like 1 second haha Real, roads are just tracks but bigger Nurburgring is the biggest PRIVATE track The real track is the road  Police is the safety car, but instead of being behind you need to be in front off them British roads are so good you get porpoising even without floor effect Indians weren\\'t Independent? (Sry for ignorance) Ah ok hahaha nan This os amazing Idnyou told me it was official I would\\'ve believed it Let\\'s wait and see, only time can tell F1 twitter Toto is always cool with lewis and George  Kvyat has flag, no way haha nan nan XD Seb didn\\'t know that Kimi was there, if Kimi wasn\\'t there it would be fine, but Ferrari didn\\'t had the engine to compete in the remaining circuits He was very good, he break the nurburgring record on the warmup lap, then he crashed on his second lap, that\\'s why he has his eye a little bit sleepy. 28 Just joking hahaha It depends on the driving style For me I prefer oversteer and a pointy front A front that turns in If the rear is unstable I can use it in my favour to rotate the car, but it can betray you sometimes and the car is more unstable. Understeer the car is more stable, it requires a different type of driving style. True, seb never liked rear unstable cars, that\\'s why he struggled with the 2014 redbull and 2020 Ferrari Both cars were rear limited Seb likes a precise front with a stable rear Alonso drives anything they give him haha He is a legend Yo what ? ahahahahah So many races, he was so unlucky Monza Zandvoort Both qualifyings were amazing, but he was unlucky in lap 1 o both He could have finished maybe top 5 on those races, but yeh, unlucky Don\\'t forget the crazy antibodies Maybe it\\'s time for seb to return He should have waited in 2020 to sign for redbill It would be crazy lineup In 1923 Only 200 M ? Not F1 worth You need to invest 10000000000Billions to be F1 worth Meanwhile Haas producing a good car with 3 cents nan Nice Very very nice Must be expensive but hey, it\\'s a first haha Are u okay mate ?, no injuries ? XDDDD Red ? Isn\\'t the car half red ? Real Mazepin in The real goat nan True But when he has a car focused on him he is amazing It\\'s normal in the sport People always say big stuff but they don\\'t know the heat of driving an F1 car at 300 km/h maximum concentration Put a microphone on the football guys, 99% of what they say it\\'s super super offensive. Same ideia ahahah Wow Zawm That\\'s not very realistic is it hahaha Ahahahah Go and protest to get Hamilton\\'s 8 championship Meanwhile I will get a way to get Hamilton disqualified in 2017 and 2018 so seb can win nan It\\'s realistic Wait a sec I will send u Yes looks like it Let\\'s see XD Nice job F1 boys Money >>>>> XD Crash gate McLaren p1 Ah i saw this xD I love this ones I like the one about how lando could\\'ve won the 2021 championship And he changed like everything And lando only won by like 3 points Nah it\\'s Villeneuve, it\\'s normal he always says dramatic stuff to keep relevant Nice Ahahahah Updates ? Tell that to china money I can\\'t resist 30 Millions XD F1 twitter be like There is a guy with a profile pick with Jarry (from Tom and Jarry) he always says that but he says: Lewis CARmilton ? Not top 1000000 in my book Sometimes I hope that these tweets are from bots and not real people  Imagine if they used that time to for example: run. They would win the Olympics in 2 months of training hahaha Nah, kmag is a good driver, he is just sleeping  Lel nan Awesome king Keep going This was like: they posted: max took out Kimi and Vettel or something like that haha BRUH XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD nan XD Source now Yikes what happened to Man U  feel bad for there fans Wrong its an old GP2 car However that guy is a legend Oh 100% Fuck the police and road laws, race car on the road bitch  Oh hell yeah Haha I can imagine me ripping it around single track British country roads And then end up in a tree probably Ha This is so true I always put this on Seb he should not have cut across the way he did Bro what have I just read  So Ive just found out merc are running a special livery this weekend Remember the last time merc had a one off livery  I mean Ill be missing the race sadly so I wont be able to see the mess Nice Ill be getting an operation Ankle rebuild I was at karting event and it was pissing it down, I spun off and then somebody after me spun off and went straight into my ankle and shattered it Hahha amazing  Would help ya Mate that was a proper Jeremy Clarkson moment  Left ankle Man fuck that  Id rather have broken nothing nan Bruh The karts are just shopping carts with a rc engine  Billy is a legend Defo ankle How can I play F1 22 with 1 working arm I didnt get it Wait is the livery shite What the fuck is that piece of shit Looks like the Ferrari and Mercedes shagged over the summer brake I was actually never a fan of this livery I really disliked the silver part of it I get what your saying that would look better, but for some reason I could never seem to like this livery For me the best Mercedes livery ever is 2019  Or even testing 2020 livery Oh 100% Best 2022 livery by a mile Personally Im not a fan of the McLaren however the Alpine is amazing Haas livery is amazing Which teams in particular? Ohh I see And that I do agree with because I cant think of any ugly liveries past 2019 tbh I didnt like the 2019 Williams that livery was horrid Well everything about Williams in 2019 was horrid  Anyone off to Spa this weekend?
